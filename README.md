This was an assigment i worked on during my time at uni. It is programed in java using the IDE CodeBlocks. 

It is a simulation of bird flocking where you can edit 3 variables: Alignment, cohesion and avoidment.
These alter the behaviour of each individual unit and how it interacts with the flock as a whole.
